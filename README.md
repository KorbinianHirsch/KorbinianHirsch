# Hi there, I'm Korbinian Hirsch👋

Welcome to my digital workshop!

I'm a Data & AI enthusiast with a unique background: I hold a **B.Sc. in Civil Engineering** and am now bridging the physical and digital worlds as a first-semester student of **B.Sc. Artificial Intelligence & Data Science** at OTH Regensburg.

My goal is to leverage my analytical engineering mindset to build intelligent systems that solve complex, real-world problems.
